## Project description

The use and implementation of robotics in the nuclear industry has become increasingly important over the past few decades.  Catastrophic  power plant accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima demonstrated the need for radiation detection robots. Nuclear power plants need to be able to identify radiation hotspots during regular leakage detection, and locate sources during an emergency response. Given the human health risks due to high level radioactive sources, it is clear there is a need for a semi-automated method for radiation detection. RADical Robotics is currently developing a semi-autonomous radiation detection robot with the use of a compton imaging camera and a high resolution H3D M400 detector.
